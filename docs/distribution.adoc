# Loader Distribution

Some overview text

## Windows

### Installation

The loader is intended to be distributed alongside each Vulkan driver.


To install the Vulkan runtime from a driver INF file, a driver should perform the following tasks on a 64-bit OS:

- Use `CopyFiles` with `COPYFLG_NO_VERSION_DIALOG` to copy `RunTimeInstaller\x64\vulkan-1.dll` to both `System32\vulkan-1.dll` and `System32\vulkan-1-999-0-0-0.dll`.
- Use `CopyFiles` with `COPYFLG_NO_VERSION_DIALOG` to copy `RunTimeInstaller\x64\vulkaninfo.exe` to both `System32\vulkaninfo.exe` and `System32\vulkaninfo-1-999-0-0-0.exe`.
- Use `CopyFiles` with `COPYFLG_NO_VERSION_DIALOG` to copy `RunTimeInstaller\x86\vulkan-1.dll` to both `SysWOW64\vulkan-1.dll` and `SysWOW64\vulkan-1-999-0-0-0.dll`.
- Use `CopyFiles` with `COPYFLG_NO_VERSION_DIALOG` to copy `RunTimeInstaller\x86\vulkaninfo.exe` to both `SysWOW64\vulkaninfo.exe` and `SysWOW64\vulkaninfo-1-999-0-0-0.exe`.

On a 32-bit OS, the driver INF should perform the following actions:

- Use `CopyFiles` with `COPYFLG_NO_VERSION_DIALOG` to copy `RunTimeInstaller\x86\vulkan-1.dll` to both `System32\vulkan-1.dll` and `System32\vulkan-1-999-0-0-0.dll`.
- Use `CopyFiles` with `COPYFLG_NO_VERSION_DIALOG` to copy `RuntimeInstaller\x86\vulkaninfo.exe` to both `System32\vulkaninfo.exe` and `System32\vulkaninfo-1-999-0-0-0.exe`.

In addition to this, driver INF installations should include the license files that are provided with the signed loader binaries, `LICENSE.txt` and `VULKANRT_LICENSE.rtf`.
These files may be installed to any directory of the driver's choosing.

### Uninstallation

Neither the bundled executable installer, nor INF installations are allowed to remove the files that were installed.
As such, there is no uninstallation except by manually deleting these files.
If an uninstaller were to delete these files, Vulkan would stop working on any system that has multiple Vulkan drivers installed.
Currently, there is no known method to solve this conflict without violating the restrictions imposed by Windows on Universal Windows Drivers.

A driver uninstaller is allowed (though not required) to remove the license files, `LICENSE.txt` and `VULKANRT_LICENSE.rtf` on uninstallation.

### Old Vulkan Runtimes

In the past, the Vulkan runtime executable was shipped by all driver installations.
However, this installer violated the requirement imposed upon newer driver installers by the requirements of Universal Windows Drivers.
Furthermore, the old runtime installer was overly complicated, as it attempted to keep versioned copies of old runtimes so that it could downgrade systems during an uninstallation.

While the old runtime logic has been retired, it is essential that new installations preserve compatibility with old runtimes.
This is the purpose of the files with 999 in the filename.
These files appear to old runtime installers as Vulkan version 999.
As such, they are always treated as the latest version, which means that old runtime installers will always update `vulkan-1.dll` and `vulkaninfo.exe` by overwriting these files with the 999 file.
This is why the 999 files are required to be identical.

Furthermore, while `vulkan-1.dll` is required for a Vulkan application to run, `vulkaninfo.exe` is not.
However, due to the limitations of the old runtime installer, `vulkaninfo.exe` must be installed as well.
Old runtimes check for the latest version of every file.
If they do not match, the runtime installer will fail and could end up downgrading the system to an older version of Vulkan.
As such, it is important that drivers install `vulkaninfo.exe` to maintain backwards compatibility.
